# What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
The stock market is a major topic in modern life. Investors can easily purchase new stocks and gain significant profits from dividends provided in the companyâ€™s bonus program for shareholders. Investors can also trade their own stocks with the other traders in the stock market via stock brokerages and electronic trading platforms. The stock exchange reflects market capitalism, and millions of stocks are traded every day. Stock movement prediction has attracted many researchers in multiple disciplines, including computer science, statistics, economics, finance, and operations research. These are based on long-term and short-term market trading activities that reflect different trading patterns. Our aim is to analyze one of those trading patterns called intraday trading. Intraday trading is highly dependent on the news about a specific stock on a given day. Our prime goal is to look at how sentiment analysis on stock news affects stock movement. With significant breakthroughs in data science and machine learning, today, we have different techniques to analyze almost all forms of data available.
